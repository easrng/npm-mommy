# npm-mommy

Mommy's here to support you when running npm~ ❤️

Based on [cargo-mommy](https://github.com/Gankra/cargo-mommy)

# Installation

Install npm-mommy like you would any other node module~

```text
> npm install npm-mommy
```

# Usage

Run whatever npm command you would normally but add mommy after npm~

# Configuration

By default mommy will assume you're her little girl, but if you want something else just set `NPM_MOMMYS_LITTLE` or `CARGO_MOMMYS_LITTLE` in your environment to your preferred affectionate term~
